# Day 1

## Subjects

- variables
- strings and integers
- multi-line strings
- doubles and booleans
- string interpolation
- constants
- type annotations

## Notes

1. Swift is type safe language.
2. You can use underscore(_) for big numbers.
3. You can not change the type of variable.
4. You can use multi-line string with three quotes(""").  First and last line break won't be included your string. 
5. You can use backslash(\) in multiline string. That mean's don't line break.
6. You can use double and float for fractional values. 
7. Double is 2 times accuracy than float. 
8. Booleans have 2 type of values. true and false.
9. Swift has a awesome feature that's called "String interpolation"
10. If u want to print some variable in your string you can use \(variableName) in your string.
11. It works with any type. So it's generic.
12. Constants is useful when we don't want to change its value.
13. Type inference is useful when we work with complex types. It ensures light syntax.
14. When we want to explicitly indicate its type its called type annotations.
15. Sometimes we have to use type annotations (polymorphism).
