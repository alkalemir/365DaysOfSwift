## Subjects

- Operators
- Operator Overloading
- Compound assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Conditions
- Logical operators
- Ternary operator
- Switch statements
- Range operators



## Notes

1. You can plus operator with arrays, string, int. This is operator overloading.
2. If both sides of divider(/) operator is int the outcome result is will be int.
3. Compound assignment operators is shorthand syntax for 
    <pre><code>
        str = str + "bla bla" // str += "bla bla"
    </code></pre>
4. Compound operators returns boolean value.
5. We can compare to string according to place of alphabet.
6. Swift has a short circuit behavior for logical operators.
7. Ternary operator is useful when we used to short if else statement.
8. Switch statements are useful when we have too much if clause.
9. Switch works with strings and range operators.
10. You have to provide default case if not all cases checked.
11. Closed range operator (...) conforms to CountableClosedRange protocol. Left and right operand are included.
12. Half-open range operator (..<) conforms to CountableRange protocol. Left is included and right is not.
13. Half-open range operator works perfectly with arrays.
