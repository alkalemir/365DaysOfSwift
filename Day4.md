# Day 4

## Subjects

- For loops
- While loops
- Repeat loops (do-while)
- Exiting loops (break)
- Exiting multiple loops with label
- Skipping items (continue)
- Infinite loops


## Notes

1. For loops works fine with ranges.
2. while loops can be used for infinite loop.
3. repeat loops guaranteed the loop at leans runs once.
4. sometimes we have 2 loops and we want to exit outer loop, for do that we have to specify which loop we want to break. We can do that with labels in swift.
5. We can skip loop with continue.
